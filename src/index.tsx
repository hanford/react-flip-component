/**
 * 
 * Detailed breakdown on FLIP technique
 * https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/
 * 
 * tl;dr
 * 
 * FLIP stands for First, Last, Invert, Play
 * 
 * This technique is relatively straightforward.. Knowing that there is a 100ms 
 * timeframe from when we change an elements position to the browser painting
 * the new position, we can do some trickery in that timeframe resulting in a clean
 * animation
 * 
 * First: We store where the element was
 * Last: We get the coordinates of where the element is moving to
 * Invert: Before the browser repaints the elements from old to new position, 
 * calculate the delta and apply transforms to the element so it's position is where 
 * the "first" step.
 * Play: The has rendered our element in a state where it appears to still be in the
 * "first" position, we remove the transform offsets, and the element will translate
 * to the "last" position.
 * 
 * By using transforms we should get dat 60fps HW accelerated animation, too! ðŸ”¥
